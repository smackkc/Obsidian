SOC 324: 90.2% (A-) - hard to say, waiting for more grades
PSY 350: 84.5% (B) - done deal, impossible to get an A, just dont fail too hard on the last exam and ill hold the B
CNIT 255: 96.44% (A)  - If I get a C on the project, I get a A-, if I get better than a C, I get an A
CNIT 242: 90.6622% (A) - We are praying on the curve for this one. TA said 2-3%, which would put me comfortably in A range, but I still need to not fuck up the final exam.
CNIT 271: 92.05% (A) - missing final project, missing a few assignments, but overall quite set. dont fuck it up. also doesn't include the 2.5% EC from course eval.


PRIORITY LIST:
1. 242 - This is a high priority because it's hard as fuck and maintaining a high grade in it is baller as fuck
2. 255 - Firstly, should be a very easy A. Secondly, would be embarrassing to get less than an A.
3. 271 - kinda easy, kinda whatever, if i get a b anything it should be this because its kinda stupid to learn this material. although i could definitely get an A and should try to. do better on the second midterm at least.
4. SOC 324 - this class is so whatever lol. dont be a retard and read the book though. should definitely shoot for an A- at least.
5. PSY 350 - This class is over I think, can't move it out of a B without luck combined with extraordinary effort
