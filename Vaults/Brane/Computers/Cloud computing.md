NIST defines cloud computing as a "model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services, that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction."

### 3 basic forms:
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a product that allows for applications of other software to be accessed over a browser. This removes the hassle of managing computer systems such as updating, maintenance, etc.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides a platform for a customer's applications to run on. It is essentially a virtual machine. 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides the resources of the underlying cloud infrastructure like servers. They may even have limited control of certain networking components. It is the most technical product, and also the most popular (generally). Most popular way to host a website these days. 

Each of these solutions is essentially the same product with different levels of customer control

Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Rackspace are all major competitors in this industry. There's also open-source clouds, which Brightspace for example runs on

### 4 deployment models
Public cloud - Made available to the general public or a large industry group, owned by an organization selling cloud services. Cloud provider is responsible for infrastructure, security, and data in their cloud. 
Community cloud - A cloud hosted on the public internet, but that requires authentication and authorization to access. Cloud owner determines who and how access is provided.
Private cloud - Implemented within the internal IT environment of an organization. Can be either in house or contracted out. Can also be used to support legacy systems.
Hybrid cloud - allows a business to cordon off part of their cloud as private and part of it as public
