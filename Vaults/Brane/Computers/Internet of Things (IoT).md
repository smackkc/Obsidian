The Internet of Things ([[IoT]]) is a concept that describes the informal network of IP enabled devices a typical user uses to make their life easier. For example, someone's phone might be connected to their home lights, their home thermostat, their car, their camera doorbell, and they might have an app that tells them the schedule for the transit line they use to commute. Such small networks of devices are also useful in other contexts, such as military applications or industrial applications. Applications of this concept in those sectors results in things like real time package tracking.
Often uses [[Cloud computing]] to provide services.

Edge computing describes the concept of a group of computers in between a cloud environment and the IoT. 
	Can serve many functions
	For example, may control which data to send back and forth to the cloud to reduce waste, collect analytics, cache data, and provide security checkpoints. 
	Can also have other auxiliary functions like reformatting data to the correct format for the cloud system, determining where to send the data, decrypting data, and exception handling.

"Fog computing" describes the cloud-linked computer networks that are closer to their customers and act as sort of a link layer between the cloud and the user
	Fog computing is a sort of category of edge computing, and has almost all of the same goals. What makes it different is that it specifically is farther away from the cloud and closer to the user, and likely under more user control.
