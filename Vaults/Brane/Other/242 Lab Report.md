for lab 2, we need 2 new sections, problem solving and troubleshooting
both go in the appendix
do NOT need table of contents for lab 2
follow template exactly for problem solving section
each problem should take probably about half a page
no in-text citations


table of contents should point to each major section; exec summary, business scenario, procedures and each header within procedures, blah blah blah

for lab 3 we need "business scenario"
	should be written from the perspective of a new lab; no results at all, just where it starts and where it will go
	for there to be a business scenario, you also need a business
		include a couple sentences of summarizing what the business is and how the domain service helps it
	we also need diagrams describing the state of the AD system at the start and a short blurb describing the diagrams
		use MS visio for experience in future deadman classes. use purdue hub, can get it for free.
		diagram should have relationship to the physical configurations; 2 optiplex 5060s, 1 optiplex 7010, one running win 10, two running win server 2019, blah blah blah
		be detailed; include computer model, FQDN, ip, os, 
		include the switch to document the *physical* connection, and include the connection from the switch to the outside network (CIT/internet)
		include logical connections as well; include VMs
	separate logical diagram describing the AD system as well
		include OUs, users, printers, subdomains, etc.
		be careful with directionality


### Results section
Lay it out in a sensible manner; typically chronological. 
Do not include procedures. 
Include context and transitions between sections
Verbally describe the layout of the system
