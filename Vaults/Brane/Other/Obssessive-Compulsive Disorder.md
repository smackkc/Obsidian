Two components, obsessions and compulsions
## [[the DSM]] definition of Obsessions:
Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images
Patient attempts to suppress, ignore, or somehow address through behavior their thoughts


## Compulsions
Repetitive behaviors (e.g. hand washing, checking, praying, counting, repeating words silently) in response to an obsession or rigid rules
Behaviors are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, they are not connected in a way that could realistically neutralize or prevent whatever they are meant to address, or they are clearly excessive


## Epidemiology
Affects 2-3% of the population. Symptoms can last a lifetime, but the extent to which they effect life often ebbs over time
To qualify for diagnosis, "The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time consuming (>1 hour per day), or significantly interfere with the person's normal routine, occupational/academic functioning, or usual social activities or relationships."
