Characterized by elevated levels of anxiety in the nervous system
Different from mood disorders, where symptoms are typically about depressed functionality, but often codiagnosed

Coping Strategies
	problem-focused - attempting to solve whatever issue may cause the anxiety
	emotion-focused - attempting to soothe the emotional response

## Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
Long-term negative reaction to a short-term traumatic event
	Typically, the traumatic event is a life-threatening event with a feeling of being trapped and powerless
	Also called "shell shock," "battle fatigue," and "combat exhaustion"
	Most often caused by a period in the military, the next most common is sexual violence

Somewhat controversially, the DSM-5 expanded the definition of what the traumatic event could be, to include people who did not directly experience the even, such as first responders, doctors, COVID nurses, etc.

DSM diagnosis has 2 components, the stressor and the intrusion symptoms
	Stressor must involve death, extreme trauma, or sexual violence
	Individual seeking diagnosis must either have experienced the event or be a close friend or family member
	Symptoms must involve at least one of the following:
		Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive memories
		Traumatic nightmares
		Dissociative reactions
		Intense or prolonged stress when seeing reminders
		Persistent avoidance of distressing trauma-related stimuli
		Negative alterations in cognitions and mood that began or worsened after the traumatic event (two required):
			inability to recall key features of the traumatic event, especially dissociative amnesia, not caused by head injury or drugs
			Persistent negative beliefs and expectations about oneself or the world
			Persistent distorted blame of self or others for causing the traumatic event or for resulting consequences
			Markedly diminished interest in significant activities
			Feeling alienated from others
		Alterations in arousal and reactivity: irritable or aggressive behavior, self-destructive, hyper-vigilance, sleep disturbance, problems in concentrations, exaggerated startle response
