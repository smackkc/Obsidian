antidepressant drugs contain a few categories
	Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) stimulate norepinephrine and serotonin
		block monoamine oxidase, an enzyme which breaks down Nepinephrine and serotonin

anxiolytics/tranquilizers
	gamma-aminobutytric acid (GABA) agonists
	highly addictive
	often overprescribed by general physicians for patient who complain about mood problems
