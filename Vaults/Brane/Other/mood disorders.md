## Bipolar Disorder
affects 1-2% of the population, appears in early adulthood
about 20% of those diagnosed attempt suicide
symptoms worsen in the first decade, episodes lose frequency after 20 years

has a larger biochemical basis than other disorders
mania & depression are reactions to each other; result of overcorrections
also problems in inhibition/disinhibition centers
appears to be highly genetic
also appears more often in those with older fathers; direction of causality is hard to determine

lithium carbonate alleviates "all or most" symptoms for 80% of individuals
	has serious side effects, including on heart and kidneys, especially if the dose is not precise
anticonvulsant meds can treat depressive episodes as well
