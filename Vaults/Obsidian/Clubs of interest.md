ASL Club - https://www.boilerlink.purdue.edu/organization/americansignlanguageclub
	No pay, every other thursday at 7, seems pretty chill. Probably wanna go.
Biology Club - https://www.boilerlink.purdue.edu/organization/biologyclub
	$20/yr or $10/sem (get the year one so I get the shirt) but they give food at the meetings so evens out
	Seems a bit more academic. More private too, need to attend call-out to join, I could proobably hit someone up though.
	I think i wanna do this, will have to vibe it out
"Everything" Club - https://www.boilerlink.purdue.edu/organization/everythingclub
	Free, not sure how well kept this is but it's kind of intriguing. Entirely depends on the people in it.
