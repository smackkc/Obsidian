The demonological model, likely the earliest model of psychiatry, supposes that mental illness is a product of demonic possession or influence. 

Among the debate over dualism, Hippocrates proposed the humors, which explained many medical situations, including mental illness. He proposed 4 humors: phlegmatic (slow), melancholia (sad), sanguine (happy), and choleric (quick-tempered). 

Medieval attitudes towards mental illness were also mostly demonological; the Spanish Inquisition specifically went and sought out women who they thought were witches. The medieval era did begin the practice of putting the mentally ill into asylums.

In the 1700s, there were reform movements led by people like Pussin and Pinel that focused on treating patients with care and understanding. This movement was not successful for very long. 
Asylums were the solution for most places. Asylums were not made for treating people, but instead keeping them away from public society. Treatments were often worse, such as lobotomies.

In the mid-20th century, the developed world moved towards "community mental health", which focused on moving people out of centralized asylums and into shorter-term decentralized clinics. This was aided by the development of new types of drugs, antipsychotics, which allowed many people to reintegrate. 
Many, many people who were in asylums ended up homeless.
