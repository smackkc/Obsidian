The sociocultural perspective supposes that mental illness is a social construct (duh) and that it has its roots in failures of society. 
	Ethnic, regional, national variations in incidence of mental illness
	SES can be both a cause and consequence of mental illness (downward drift hypothesis)
		Significant stigma against mental illness
	Focuses on medicalization of normal processes, depriving people of agency

Biopsychosocial perspective tries to synthesize every perspective into one "interactionist" perspective

Diathesis-stress model argues that environmental stressors can trigger biological vulnerabilities, causing mental illness. 

Types of mental health professionals/practitioners:
	Psychiatrists - Medical doctors, med degrees with specialist training. Can prescribe drugs.
	Psychologist - PhD or PsyD; counseling and clinical therapy; *not* a medical degree, *cannot* prescribe drugs (most of the time). They can tell your GP to prescribe you stuff though.
	Clinical social workers (MSW) 
	Counselors (MA, MS, MSW)
	Therapists (???) 
		Unregulated term. Can be used by anyone above, or people without degrees.
