Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) - Standardized by both OSI and IETF (RFC 4510). Used for querying and modifying information in a directory. Supports directory services over TCP/IP over port 389. 
	Lighter replacement for DAP. 

Active Directory - Windows directory service since Windows 2000. Replaced NTDS. Based on X.500. Uses LDAP as its native directory access protocol. 

eDirectory - Previously NDS (Novell Directory Services). Available in Novell Netware 4.0. Loosely based on X.500.

Open Directory - Directory service used by Apple OS X. Uses LDAP and Kerberos, integrates with AD.

Large organizations have a big need for directory services. Multiple locations, multiple departments, can get very complicated very quickly. Directories are a way of keeping it all straight.

Smaller organizations have a lower need. Most small organizations do not need directories, or can use just one location in a directory. Sapling rather than tree.
