R/K Selection Theory
	Weird theory about how there's 2 mating strategies, R and K. R is fast and impulsive, have as many children as possible, K is slow and cautious. 
	Theory prescribes that men are dominantly R type and women are more dominantly K type, and that men are therefore also more likely to commit crime
	There's also a "cheater theory", that the R type men are a violent minority. 
		Obvious cycle with the children of R types becoming violent/R types themselves; R men do not raise their children and often have children with lower-class, less intelligent women, resulting in a not ideal childhood experience
