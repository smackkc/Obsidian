Biological positivism - result of applying theories of the early enlightenment to crime. human behavior is a product of biological, social, psychological, or economic forces. All human activity can be verified by scientific principles.

Trait theory supposed that crime had a biological root. 
William Sheldon created his somatotype theory, based on the physique. "Mesomorphs," (strong people?) were the most likely to commit crimes, "Endomorphs" are too heavy and slow to engage in crime, and "Ectomorphs" are lanky intellectuals and are the least likely to commit crimes. 
These ideologies lead to the creation of plastic surgery. Plastic surgery began in prisons on prisoners to reshape their appearance to be less criminal-like. 

Modern biological influences on crime are much more subtle and less broad in their claims.

Some theorize that sugar metabolism can have an influence on crime. The brain runs on sugars, so an inability to digest them can lead to the brain slowing down and perhaps an increase in the chance of committing crime. Studies on prison populations show a higher rate of sugar metabolism issues.

Lead poisoning duh, other stuff like mercury too
Mothers using substances while pregnant leads to more deviance
Allergies can also have a small impact. Possibly other sources of inflammation too? Insecticide, pesticides, etc.
