The Uniform Crime Report (UCR) is a record collected by the FBI that aggregates crimes reported to local police departments and the number of arrests made by police agencies. It's Part I and Part II crimes
	Three sections:
		Number of crimes reported and arrests made
		Crime rates per 100,000; per capita adjusted crime rates over the country
		Changes in crime rate over time
	A "clearance rate" in the UCR is the estimated rate that offenders are arrested
	UCR ==does not== report drug crimes
	Is UCR valid?
		Reporting is not often consistent due to lack of confidence in the police, insurance reasons, fear of reprisal, lack of importance, or one's own criminal involvement
		Methodology issues
			No federal crimes reported
			Hierarchy rule; if there's multiple crimes committed in one incident, only the most serious crime is reported
			Not all departments report
			No distinction between complete and incomplete acts
			Differences between FBI and state definitions

The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) attempts to resolve some of the shortcomings of the UCR
	Includes more offense categories and details than the UCR
	Indicates links between arrests and clearances
	No hierarchy rule
	Distinguishes between attempted and completed attempts
	The issue is that only 35% of departments report to NIBRS

Survey research gets used most often
	The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is a yearly household survey on victims that seeks to collect information on all crimes, not just reported ones. It's a very, very large representative sample. Ran by DOJ.
	Does not ask victims their own involvement in crime, so impossible to draw any conclusions there
	Also not a great measure for homicide obviously
	Memory issues; people may not remember every event
	Does not track drug crime

Anonymous self-report surveys ask participants to describe their lifetime participation in criminal activity
	Obviously very important to keep this information safe for the sake of continued reporting
