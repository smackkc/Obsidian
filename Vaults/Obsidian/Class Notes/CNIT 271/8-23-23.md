NISTIR defines access control as "The process of granting or denying specific requests to obtain and use information and related information processing services and to enter specific physical facilities"

RFC defines it as "a process by which use of system resources is regulated according to a security policy and is permitted only by authorized entities according to that policy"

AC policies and models

Discretionary access control (DAC) is where the owners determine which users have access to their resources
	Copying issue - authorized users can copy and give access to other unauthorized users

Mandatory access control (MAC) controls access based on security clearances

Role-based access control (RBAC) controls access based on roles that users have within the system

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) controls access based on attributes of the user, the resource to be accessed, and current environmental conditions

*Subjects* are entities capable of accessing objects.
	Three classes: owner, group, world

*Objects* are resources to which access is controlled. An entity used to contain and/or receive information

*Access rights* describe the way in which a subject may access an object. E.x. read, write, execute

Operational model specifies the decision function for the access decision (allow/deny)

Administrative models specify the model's dynamics and operation.
