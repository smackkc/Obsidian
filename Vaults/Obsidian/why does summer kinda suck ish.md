the main issue with summer is that there's no weekly schedule. 

i propose the 4 day week for summer. 4 days on, 3 off. (it's a break after all.)

future summers: build around this, make internships remote capable at least or something for europe vacation. 

obvious that in previous summers spiraling-ish is partially due to having no schedule or resopnsibility. these months are usually lost to me. i am going to be reclaiming them going forward. 
rest is good, which is why i have 3 day weekends all summer hopefully. 


also, no more wagie shit. i am a professional now. i don't fit in with high schoolers.





>what do "off days" look like?
>>no money. videogames? other hobbies, like reading, drawing, or guitar.  no caffeine. complete low energy. aalyn sure, but nothing too involved.
>what do "on days" look like?
>>homework, making food, gym, Resting, talking to people, caffeine, fancy dates, doing stuff


how do internships fit into this? virtual? no homework? idk if im doing more online classes i've gotten like a semester ahead in misc credits atp
remote internship sounds fake as fuck like i dont know how much that really says to a company. or if they really even exist. but a remote internship would be nice asf.
from what i hear about internships your position is never super important so taking time off for vacations and stuff shouldn't be too hard. but i do not have any experience in anything truly professional so i have no clue how that whole scene operates. hamza didn't seem to have a hard time getting time off when we came to istanbul.
