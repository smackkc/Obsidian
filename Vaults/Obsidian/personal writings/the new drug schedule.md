# ==***THESE ARE CEILINGS, NOT TARGETS***==
***you dont need to be doing any drug more than once a month. marijuana has kind of broken your brain when it comes to when/how often it's acceptable to get intoxicated. it is important to hold in your mind that these values are absolute maximums designed to avoid addiction, not the gold standard for healthful drug use.***
punishments reset if broken (do not stack) unless otherwise specified
drugs not listed are drugs i don't do

NO recreational drugs on weekdays unless there's a concert or some event like that which would justify it

CANNABANOIDS
	PROHIBITED INDEFINITELY; MINIMUM ONE YEAR; REASSESS JANUARY 2024 
	SMOKING STRICTLY PROHIBITED; EXCLUSIVELY ORAL
	1x/month? researchers mark "heavy use" as >2x/week; i think this is way too high though. 1x/month feels good, it's closer than 2x/week to how often i used when i used in moderation. NEW NOTE: I've moved discussion of this to [[how often is acceptable to use weed?]]
	prohibition for one month; additional infractions reset prohibition to a month + 1 week per infraction

MDMA
	Monthly at most; on the ground, keep closer to 2-3 months ==(AND MUST TAKE NEUROPROTECTIVES)==
	prohibition for one year; failure to take neuroprotectives: prohibition for 3 months

KETAMINE
	Every other week at most; in practice 1-2x a month. 
	prohibition OF ALL GABAERGICS (INCLUDING PREGABALIN) for one month per infraction

2C-B & ANALOGUES
	every other week? 2C-B is very self limiting. reassess if use reaches 3x/month.
	no punishments; self-limiting

OPIOIDS (recreational; medicinal use per doctor's orders and *NO LEFTOVERS*)
	**STRICTLY NO POSSESSION**; CODEINE, HYDROCODONE, OXYCODONE, OPIUM **ONLY**
	1x/year
	complete prohibition for any infraction

AMPHETAMINES
	1x/month recreational ==(INCLUDES MDMA)==; academic use as needed (self limiting, 3x/month max; you should do most studying sober and use amphs as a last resort if homework is piling up)
	(academic use defined as <10mg; a dose >10mg is 'recreational' regardless of whether the spirit of the use was recreational or academic; 10mg figure may be adjusted downwards, reassess after some experimentation)
	to clarify, MDMA counts as amphetamines, but amphetamines do not count as MDMA
	complete recreational prohibition for 1 year (excluding MDMA). academic use 1x/month for 2 months.

MEMANTINE
	self-limiting, no rules; reassess if use climbs to 4x/month

PREGABALIN/GABAPENTIN
	(these both are rolled into one; consider rolling ketamine into them as well?)
	3x a month
	novel and difficult to gauge. i think this schedule is fine for now, lots of people are prescribed daily doses of this stuff, but hamza seems to think im prone to addiction to it. reassess the schedule if the rule is broken more than once.
	prohibition for two months
