i don't think it's really possible for me to answer this question when i'm not done rooting out the addiction mind virus yet. but i can try i guess.

edit; god how much does it fucking suck that ron desantis has claimed the phrase 'mind virus' it sounds so fucking lame now. god it's such a useful concept too. nuke florida. no longer taking my talents to miami. maybe austin. 

1x a month feels golden. i've seen several observational studies that lump users by daily, weekly, monthly, sub-monthly, and non-users, and monthly users are quite often indistinguishable (by the parameters of the studies) from non-users. when considering the other host of drugs that I have available to use on other weekends, only having one weekend a month to use weed feels fine to me.
