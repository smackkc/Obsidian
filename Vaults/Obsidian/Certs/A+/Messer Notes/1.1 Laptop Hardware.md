Laptops suck to fix because they're small and often proprietary. 

Keycaps are actually really sensitive. You need to get surgical on that shit. Look up the manufacturer's guidance.
Laptops use SO-DIMM memory (Small Outline In-line Memory Module), and is sometimes easy to install and replace. These days a lot of laptops sodder the memory straight to the mobo though.
Hard storage comes in either 2.5" HDD, 2.5" SSD, or M.2 SSD. 
HDD to SSD upgrades are pretty common. The best way to do this is to clone or image the old hard drive. This is a good skill to develop in general because it's a common practice for enterprise IT.
	You can either create an "image file" and transfer it over a cable or the internet one drive at a time, or you can plug both drives into one machine and do a drive-to-drive image, which will likely require a computer more capable than a laptop
