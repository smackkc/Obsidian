this relationship is so exhausting. i have never felt more drained in my life.

every time there's a stressful point in my life, a point where i'm tested and where failure is both possible and consequential, every time i might want to lean on this relationship for support, it ends up bursting into flames and causing me even more stress

i am an enabler. it's all that i do because it's all that i'm allowed to do. otherwise, i get punished. if i suggest she fix something, doubtless i will need to deal with 20 minutes of tears minimum. and she thinks she can just do that for as long as she wants, and that it has no effect on me.
