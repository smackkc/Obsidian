Hello. Today is November 20, 2023. It is 4 A.M. and I am on Vyvanse. I saw Sara Landry in Chicago yesterday. And today, I should be studying for my CNIT 271 exam, but instead I am consumed by thoughts of ending my relationship. At this point, I feel like I need to. I originally made this document on july 28, and concluded then that I shouldn't break up. I'm redoing this now, trying to reorganize it in a bit of a clearer and more helpful way. 

2. HOW MUCH OF MY UNHAPPINESS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AALYN, AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYONE?
	1. What is my unhappiness with Aalyn?
		1. Unbelievably needy/high maintenance
		2. Incredibly strange sense of ownership over my time. UPDATE: We talked about this and she's backed off a bit, but I can tell there has not been any serious self-examination on her part. The only thing that has changed is her behavior, but I can tell she has not at all, and I can also tell she's had some emotional response to me making her change her behavior.
		3. Irresponsible; low executive function
		4. I cannot trust her to maker her own decisions most of the time
		5. Her family is.. questionable at best, disgusting at worst (more realistically).
		6. While she recognizes many of the ways her family is disgusting and revolts against some of those elements, she seems incapable of truly learning from the whole experience and applying what she's learned. It requires too much intervention on my part that often ends up being too forceful.
			1. I would not be willing to date/marry a pure example of her family members. I find them kind of revolting. If she does not take a harder line against her upbringing and instead regresses into it, the relationship cannot continue.
		7. She cannot recognize that her problems are our problems. She seems much more interested in my problems than she does her own. This feels almost intentional at this point.
			1. Cannot blame her exactly for trying to intentionally obscure this logic, despite it being obviously true. It would involve a lot of guilt on her part, which she cannot accept, she must always be right about everything.
		8. She makes it difficult for me to grow
		9. She has no idea what I want. I also have no idea what I want, but she has even less of an idea.
		10. She has absolutely no clue what she wants, I think the best place to start with her would be asking her what she feels like she wants and then writing down the exact opposite of that.
		11. She cannot ever truly test/challenge herself
		12. She cannot make it through a single conversation about topics like this without crying. She can not really make it a single day without crying. And (back to #7) she cannot (will not?) see how this effects me too.
		13. I put in much more to this relationship than she does. UPDATE: since falling out of love, I really am not sure this is true anymore. But it feels true.
		14. We cannot be a normal couple who hangs out with other couples or other people in general because she will just go nonverbal if she's around someone she doesn't already know. 
		15. We cannot go places with higher than average levels of stimulation or she will just shut down or have a panic attack
		16. She will practically never take initiative to fix anything unless I push her to or just do it herself
		17. Very poor communicator. Cannot hash out her thoughts. Will just sit there and say nothing instead. Mostly a runoff of #3 and #12.
	2. Line item basis: which of these problems are probably general to most relationships?
		1. Certainly not all of them; ballpark of 60-80% maybe though, otherwise the concept of 'high-maintenance' wouldn't exist
		2. Almost none. This one I think is exclusive. She is so unbelievably inconsiderate about this.
		3. Also very uncommon, but more common than #2. I think (hope?) this goes away with time. If it doesn't it will be a serious thing to consider breaking up over.
		4. Also uncommon, at least among the girls I typically have my eye on. Definitely didn't need to worry about whether or not Sophie could make her own decisions.
		5. Depressingly common. Most Americans are actually insane. But a weird truth is that being in college is one of the best times to find people whose families are not crazy. UPDATE: I have a bit more experience and feel like I think this is a bit less true now. I think most families are less insane than Aalyn's. 
		6. For the people who do have awful families, I think this describes nearly all of them.
		7. Very very rare, it's a specific consequence of her pushing more emotional labor onto me than vice versa.
			1. Could a cure be pushing more emotional labor onto her? How do I even do that?
				1. I've tried this in the past without realizing it, upon further reflection. Each time I stop because she has an emotional outburst that is worse than mine and ends up making me feel bad. Which kind of speaks for itself here.
		8. Hard to say without more experience; "she makes it harder" =/= she makes it impossible. So far I've made it work for the most part I think. UPDATE: you're wrong dumbass. you could have been so much more if you stuck to the plan. 
		9. This is almost everyone i think
		10. Also ^
		11. Most people, but not most people in college
		12. Probably about 50%; I see this discussed a lot
		13. Uncommon
		14. Incredibly rare
		15. Quite rare
		16. Hard to say
		17. Rare, common among our age group though
3. HOW DO I CONTRIBUTE TO THE DYSFUNCTION OF OUR RELATIONSHIP?
	1. I'm a drug addict
	2. Awful communicator, but I am trying to get better
	3. I'm very ambitious
	4. I have a very weird thing with the sensation of touch
	5. I have weird interests
	6. I'm extremely introverted; need a high portion of alone time
	7. I like money a bit too much
	9. High standards (she should want this?)
	10. I do not act or pretend. I show my feelings on my face
4. WHAT IS RIGHT IN OUR RELATIONSHIP THAT IS NOT RIGHT WITH MOST RELATIONSHIPS?
	1. We have sex I think
	2. We love each other
	3. The basic practicals are aligned; we're going to the same college, have compatible careers, and we agree on kids, god, and politics
	4. No track record of or proclivity to cheating


With a bit more clarity in my head now, I think I am even more confident that the correct course of action is to break up. I just am really concerned about what she might do afterwards. If she kills herself I dont know how I move on from that. I know it wouldn't be my fault, but it wouldn't not be my fault either. Maybe loop amanda in? I feel like there's too much loyalty there. Her mom? Jesus. What a mess. I definitely need to consult my mom, at least.
