what do we Do?

government contractor?
FOREIGN government contractor??
**look into how u.s. csec industry compares to europeans. maybe their gov'ts could use some of our sutff? would be willing to pay premium for american made? if greg actually knows swedish there's an inroad, or turkiye. or both.**
would being public sector before actually be better than founding straight out?
(probably want to build a cushion before jumping out right?)
good chance some of my picks might be younger than me too, so might have some time to wait for ppl to graduate.
what kind of ethical public sector csec jobs even exist in indy? healthcare? does that exist?

all roads lead to mic

need to think about how many fellas to start with. do i read books?  *not a bad idea. just not in public

unironically how much should i think about sammy when bringing this up to people? how much control over his mind does his ideology have?

i think in making a company i'd have to keep a promise to myself to be ethical in every operation. which includes workers. if somehow this whole thing does work and people do end up being employed by us, by that point, i think i will have sold my share. i think sammy shouldn't have any opposition to such an arrangement. if this pans out the way i imagine it will we'll be paying high premium to scope for top talent. could even hire straight out of europe if the foreign gov't contractor idea works well.

hire sophie for pr lol
