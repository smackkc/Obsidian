luis, hopefully; academics need to tighten up. i think the potential is there.

do i need a fucking business major? do i know any? does anyone i know know any?
if i just mention starting a company to enough people eventually i need to run into someone who knows a business major.
could look at people from high school going to iu kelly. 
but also before fractioning off another chunk of potential equity let's do more digging into whether or not business majors are actually useful for businessing. also i can't just vibe someone off from high school from like one convo can i? if i read enough books about it maybe. just like a cold instagram dm saying "hey, im computer man, i have 4 computer friends, and i want to start a computer company. have lunch with me."
