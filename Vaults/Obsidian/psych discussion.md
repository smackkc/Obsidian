With how naive and underdeveloped the field of psychology is, it is not surprising to see so much conflict over definitions and interpretations. Labels like autism are not scientific. There's currently no scientific process by which the concept/category of autism can be derived, and there is similarly no process to scientifically test whether or not someone falls into the category. For the lack of better phrase, it is all vibes.
With this in mind, it becomes difficult to imagine a future where psychologists agree on these labels. This is a deeply personal issue for many people, a fact illustrated nowhere as well as it is in the video we watched. So long as they still exist, passionate debate about these definitions will not stop, no matter how refined they get. 
The issue of how to define labels like autism is similar to another issue highlighted in these articles. Social movements contain hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of people. Defining what a social movement "believes in" is no simple task. Especially when trying to determine what it believes about a very specific, narrow set of definitions around abstract, clunky words like "normal" or "disabled."
Simon Baron-Cohen is not stupid, and neither is Aiyana Bailin. Otherwise, this debate would be happening in a forum other than the *Scientific American*. It is understandable that Simon Baron-Cohen would, at least according to Aiyana Bailin, misunderstand some of the basic tenets of the neurodiversity movement. It is even possible that Baron-Cohen heard contradicting information in a personal communication with someone credibly claiming to represent the neurodiversity movement. 
Moving on from labels and definitions, I do think the neurodiversity movement as characterized by Bailin holds water. Clinical cases of mental illnesses get most of the attention, but people with subclinical symptomatology of mental illnesses probably make up a larger portion of the population, in my opinion probably a majority of it. These are people who would benefit from the societal prescriptions of the neurodiversity movement. Right now, there hardly even exists the language to describe these people; "subclinical symptomatology of mental illnesses" is an absurd number of needed syllables to describe such a large population. 
ADHD is the easiest example to think of. Plenty of people have trouble focusing, plenty more people have an extremely hard time focusing, and plenty more are diagnosed with ADHD. Is there a greater difference between these three than the extent to which they have a trait? One thing I think few people think about often or ever but that everyone instinctively agrees on is that the purely social concept of a "personality" is far too limited to contain all the potential shapes a human mind can have. Perhaps the neurodiversity movement can find its role answering these questions that most people never think to ask.
