main thing is do i use the shit obsidian can do regarding links and backlinks and stuff?
what i do now works yes


make a separate vault for important concepts, keep this vault as a personal thing?
sounds like a winner

definitely figure out keybinds and shit
try to never use mouse


maybe blackpill: class notes are just for elective shit like thoughts i had during lecture, random details prof gives, club invites even, maybe some details about my day. the other one is used for real concepts. sounds good?

oh my god i'm gonna need to construct from nothing an entire encyclopedia
maybe its a good exercise
